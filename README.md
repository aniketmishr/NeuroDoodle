## About the AI

The AI model behind NeuroDoodle is a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** that was fine-tuned on a subset of the [Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). The dataset contains millions of user-drawn doodles across various categories. The model has been trained to recognize common doodle patterns with high accuracy.
